# Hunting Modpack


Includes my modified versions of throwing mod and kpgmobs mod.

Throwing mod includes bows and arrows.
Items which already existed are marked with a star (*)

Bows (from bad to best):

Wooden Bow (crafted with jungle sticks)
*Steel Bow

Bronze Bow

Carbon Steel Bow (needs technic mod)

Silver Bow (needs moreores mod)

Mithril Bow (needs moreores mod)


Good bows gives the arrows more acceleration and they fly further.
Better bows although don't break so fast, only bronze bow shoots quite far but breaks fast.
You can take items from ground now with your bow in your hand, when you hold CTRL when clicking, but not with wooden bow.



Arrows:

*normal arrow: crafted with 2 sticks and 1 iron ingot. If missed you can collect arrows from ground again.

golden arrow: crafted with 2 sticks and 1 gold ingot. You get it automatically back if you miss your target. Although you get the items which animals drop directly in your inventory.

*teleport arrow: crafted with 2 sticks and 1 MESE block. Teleports you to the position where the arrow lands. You get the arrow back.

*dig arrow: crafted with 2 sticks and a steel pick. Digs a hole in the ground where the arrow lands. Don't work in protected areas.

*build arrow: crafted with 2 sticks and a steel shovel. You need to put the block, whick should be built to the slot right of the build arrow. The arrow then places this block where it lands. Don't work in protected areas. 

*fire arrow: crafted with 2 sticks and a lava bucket. Sets nodes in fire. Maybe better disable on a server because it could do some damage to protected areas.

stealing arrow: crafted with a golden arrow and glue (from cooked saplings) or honey (from bees from kpgmobs mod)
funny new arrow which allows you to steal things from other players. If you hit a player you can get an random choosen item from their inventory. The first 8 slots which are visible in hud are safe. Items there can't be stolen. So you can protect very valuable items you don't want to loose. You only get one item, not whole stacks. There's a chance you don't steal something even when you hit.



Kpgmobs:

Includes some really sweet drawn animals. Needed to make changes, so that they drop items when hit by an arrow.
Added leather which you can get sometimes from cows, deers or horses. If you shoot them with bows, you have a higher chance of getting leather.
From leather you can make boots. 

Crafting recipe for boots: (L=Leather)
. . .
L . L
L . L

Boots let you run faster, if you have some with you. I got the idea from sprint mod, but most code is modified by myself.


Animals:

Bee: drop honey (can be eaten), rightclick them and you get a bee. 3 bees can be crafted to an uley.

Cow: drop raw meat, leather (sometimes). Rightclick a cow with an empty bucket and you get milk.

Deer: drop raw meat, leather (sometimes)

Horse: drop raw meat, leather (sometimes). If you rightclick it, you get it in your inventory. Place it again with rightclick and you can ride it. There are 3 kinds of horses: brown, white and black horses. They have all a bit differces:
      
      brown horse: not so fast, better control
      white horse: fast
      black horse: fast, jumps higher, spawns only in deserts

Jeraf: drop raw meat. Only spawn in deserts

Medved: drop raw meat. Some kind of a wild boar

Pumba: drop raw meat. Only spawn in deserts

Rat: drop nothing, can be catched with rightclick

Sheep: drop raw meat. Rightclick it to get wool

Wolf: drop raw meat. Spawns when it's getting dark and tries to kill you! But should be no problem with a good weapon
